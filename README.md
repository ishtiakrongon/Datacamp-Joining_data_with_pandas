# Datacamp- Joining Data with Pandas
 This course is for joining data in python by using pandas. I have completed this course at DataCamp.

 Being able to combine and work with multiple datasets is an essential skill for any aspiring Data Scientist. Data merging basics, merging tables with different join types, advanced merging and concatenating, merging ordered and time-series data were covered in this course.
